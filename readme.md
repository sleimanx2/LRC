## Lebanese Red Cross Intranet

The purpose for which we are developing this application, is in order to create a chain of communication for the first aiders with blood donors, parents, and hospital representatives. This application serves at enhancing, and simplifying the process of finding donors, and hence filtering out the quality donors according to their activity, GPS location, and availability. As an end result for the functionality of the application, the first aiders are able to concretely read accurate reports, according to the cumulative data collected within the application, and hence it serves at the bettering of the blood donation process, and providing accurate statistical data.
